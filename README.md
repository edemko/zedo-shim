# zedo-shim

When I'm programming, I often need a better build system.
However, the system I have in mind---`zedo`, a variant of djb's `redo`---isn't widely installed.
This shim should make it easier for users and contributors to use my `zedo`-based build systems
    without having to build and install _yet another thing_ first.

To include this shim in a project, use:

```
cd <repository>
git submodule add https://github.com/edemko/zedo-shim.git
cp -r zedo-shim/default-project .zedo
git add .zedo
```

then document the steps a user needs to run the build system:

```
git clone <repository>
cd <repository>
git submodule update --init zedo-shim
export PATH+=":$PWD/zedo-shim/bin"
zedo <all>
```

The (so far untested) idea is to include this repository as a git submodule.
Then, the user/contributor need only update the submodule and put `zedo-shim/bin` on their path.
Then the build system will work (though sub-optimally).

## Random Notes

Actually, I haven't built a real `zedo` that works.
However, that seems to be because I keep using partially-built versions in "production" environments as a test.
When I get frustrated with my progress on the "test" project because of inadequacies in `zedo`, I move to a different project and no longer have a testbed for `zedo`.

I'm hoping this shim will allow me to work on whatever project I want without too many build-system annoyances.
Then, I'll be able to put in incremental improvements to `zedo` and immediately test them on any of my projects.

Meanwhile, I'll also have to keep this shim up-to-date with new configuration, flags, commands, and what-not.
Since I don't want to do much of that in shell, I should be motivated to keep the zedo interface _very_ small.

Further, relative performance metrics should give me a better idea of how much overhead the "smart" features of true `zedo` introduces.
Admittedly, there'll be some overhead even here, what with build sub-scripts always being invoked indirectly through `zedo`.
The idea though is that incremental builds will then save a lot of time.

## Writing a Zedo Script

Create an executable file named `<output file>.do` or `default.<extension>.do`.
Okay, probably it will be a script, so give it a she-bang line at the top.

It is invoked with two or three arguments:

  * `$1`: the target directory relative to the root directory for that file type, _without_ a leading slash
  * `$2`: basename of the target (without extension for default scripts)
  * `$3` (for default scripts only): extension of the target file _including_ the leading dot
  * which means the original target is `/$1/$2$3` and replacing an extension is like `/$1/$2.o`,
    or remove the leading `/$1` for a relative path.

In addition to the arguments, there are some environmental guaranteed
  * the current working directory is the directory of the output file
  * stdout is the output file
  * stderr is the target-specific log file under `.zedo/log/...`
  * file descriptor three points to the root error log (usually directly to the terminal)
  * `$ZTOP` is set to the top of the build directory (which has copies of depended-on source files) so that actual filenames for built files can be referenced with absolute paths rather than relative paths.

For many outputs, it is sufficient to simply allow the output of a filter to be written to stdout (and from there to the output file).
However, some programs (esp. those creating binary files) require a path to the output file; I suggest `/dev/fd/1`.

If the script exits with a non-zero exit code, then it is understood to have failed, and its dependents will not be built.

Also, there's always `zedo --help | less`.
